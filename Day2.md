Day two is a heavy day because we cover a lot of information.


## Positioning:

I'll start the students off with positioning (see positioning_image.png). I'll walk them through how to build that image. I  will
leave out position relative on the parent (black and white containers). This will cause the circles to break out to each corner all the
way to the browser window. I will then start working the circles back to the black square, starting with the white square first.


### Positioning Flow

- Build a white square with a black square inside of it
- Add four circles inside the black square (this is a good time to talk about parent, child, sibling relationships )
- Show them how the circles stack before you add position absolute to them
- Add position absolute BAM!! why did they break out of the parent and the grandparent. Absolute is a rebel child!!
- Add position relative to the white container (explain what happens)
- Add position relative to the black container (explain what happens)
- Now add position fixed to the circles (fixed is the ultimate rebel child)


## Flex-box:

I'll work through how to build a navigation with flex-box first (see flexbox-image.jpg) I'll highlight how flex is a great
layout tool with lots of built in functionality i.e. justify-content, align-items etc. I generally ovoid talking about flex-grow
and flex-basis on the first day of flex. I'll leave both of those for day 3.

### Flex-box Flow:

- Build navigation found in flexbox-image.png
- Add value proposition section "WE ARE HANDCRAFTED" and the "SHOP" Call to action. Use flexbox to center align this container
- Build card_one.png under the value prop section. You should have 3 of these cards. One for the watch, shoe and bag.
- Use flex to give each item equal space between.
- Use flex-wrap to wrap each card


## Honorable mentions
- Importing fonts
- Add fonts to reset file or create a separate font file
- Meta viewport tag and why it matters
- Box-sizing:border-box

This is a great time to talk to students about how to create a solid layout. I'll do this by breaking down a really complex website
into smaller pieces. Doing this will help build their confidence because it helps them visualize how everything can be broken down
into small boxes. Introduce the box-model after this exercise.

## Mini project

- Together we will build  https://www.designbetter.co/ just the landing page, no animations.


## Landing page project (located in Day2-Materials)

### This is an alternative to the project above

- 1) Build the main background
- 2) Build the header using position absolute. Show students how links break out of header if the header doesn't have position relative.
- 3) Talk about layouts and why you would/wouldn't use position absolute
- 4) Build the header using flex
- 5) Add phone image and position using absolute
- 6) Add Content and Call to Action
